                        I'm a Digital Marketing Lover with 6 years of experience working within <strong>Digital Communication and Marketing Online.</strong> 
                        <br>
                        I specialize in <em>media acquisition</em>, which is my passion since I can help to reach real results and real growth in digital businesses.
                        <br>
                        I'm really grateful because I had the opportunity of working in companies, and also as a consultant, with people from different countries
                        like Denmark, Germany, Sweden, and others, that gave me an international broad view about how I can contribute and create value in different
                        cultures.
